- INSTALL -
-----------

mkdir oe-core
cd oe-core
git clone https://github.com/telco-tech/meta-nano.git


- BUILD -

./meta-nano/files/yocto_nano_setup.sh

This will build all the yocto stuff.


- INSTALL IMAGE -
-----------------

./meta-nano/files/flash_setup.sh

Starts tftp and bootp daemons.

./meta-nano/files/flash_nano.sh

This will flash the board. The board must be connected via Olimex ARM-USB-OCD-H.
